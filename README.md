# insar4nwp

This site is developed to show time-series of InSAR imagery, HARMONIE weather model simulations or radar data and rainfall radar side by side. To do so, all three data types were regridded to the same projection.
Data presented on this website is free to use, please refer to [Paper reference] if you want to use this data. 

# ploty.js, geotiff.js

I would like to give credits to the developers of these packages, which made the basic design of this possible.
